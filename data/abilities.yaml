          You take the form of a wild animal, adopting its shape, senses, and range of motion.
          You may choose any creature that is no smaller than a mouse and no larger than a horse.
          Everything you carry becomes part of your animal form.
      - text: >-
          While in animal form, you have 6 HP. You may make basic attacks that hit for 2 HP.
          You can't cast spells, use items, or speak languages while transformed.
      - text: >-
          You can return to your normal form at any time. When transforming back, you regain the hit points
          you had before you transformed. Falling to 0 hit points while transformed instantly returns you to your normal form.

          You open your palm, conjuring a poisonous thorn that you shoot in a straight line toward a nearby target creature or object.
          The thorn hits for 2 HP.

        text: >-
          The thorn's poison is amplified. If you hit an organic creature, its skin becomes swollen,
          it cannot see beyond its reach, and it can't speak or cast spells until the end of its next turn.

          You blow cool air, creating freezing winds that swirl around a nearby creature or object.
          Affected creatures feel a deep chill in their bones and are hit for 1 HP.
          You can use the spell to snuff out small fires.

          You freeze a nearby commoner, minion, or object, encasing it in ice until you leave the scene.
          If you freeze a creature, it cannot move or act. The ice shatters, and the creature is freed if it takes any additional damage.

          You swirl your hands in the air, producing a thick fog centered on you. 
          The fog rolls out rapidly, spilling around corners and down slopes. 
          Within a few seconds, you blanket everything nearby in fog. 
          Creatures inside the fog cannot see beyond their reach, preventing them from making ranged attacks. 
          The fog disperses after you leave the area, or if the area is hit by strong winds.

          EAGLE: You gain eagle-eye vision for the next minute. 
          You can see anything in your line of sight clearly, even if it is far away, and you can detect faraway movement that would be imperceptible to a normal person.

          CAT: You purr softly under your breath, imbuing up to 6 nearby creatures with the spirit of the cat. 
          For the next hour, affected creatures gain the ability to see things nearby in complete darkness as if they were in a dimly lit room. 
          The effect cannot pierce magical darkness. Affected creatures may occasionally feel the urge to stop what they are doing and clean themselves.

          WOLF: You howl, imbuing up to 6 nearby creatures with haste. 
          For the next hour, creatures affected by the spell can outrun any other creatures while traveling by foot.

          You whisper a rhyming couplet to the living plants around you. 
          You can write your own or borrow one from another author. 
          Use one that plants might appreciate, like "Hear my voice ring, and welcome the spring."
      - text: >-
          Your brief poem entreats the plants to produce a harmless effect by moving or growing slightly. 
          The things you want to manipulate must be within range. 
          You may make trees rustle, cause leaves to fall, get plants to bloom, vines to expand, and seeds to sprout.
