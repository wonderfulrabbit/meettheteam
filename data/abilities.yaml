          You take the form of a wild animal, adopting its shape, senses, and range of motion.
          You may choose any creature that is no smaller than a mouse and no larger than a horse.
          Everything you carry becomes part of your animal form.
      - text: >-
          While in animal form, you have 6 HP. You may make basic attacks that hit for 2 HP.
          You can't cast spells, use items, or speak languages while transformed.
      - text: >-
          You can return to your normal form at any time. When transforming back, you regain the hit points
          you had before you transformed. Falling to 0 hit points while transformed instantly returns you to your normal form.

          You open your palm, conjuring a poisonous thorn that you shoot in a straight line toward a nearby target creature or object.
          The thorn hits for 2 HP.
      - label: "20:"
        text: >-
          The thorn's poison is amplified. If you hit an organic creature, its skin becomes swollen,
          it cannot see beyond its reach, and it can't speak or cast spells until the end of its next turn.

          You blow cool air, creating freezing winds that swirl around a nearby creature or object.
          Affected creatures feel a deep chill in their bones and are hit for 1 HP.
          You can use the spell to snuff out small fires.

          You freeze a nearby commoner, minion, or object, encasing it in ice until you leave the scene.
          If you freeze a creature, it cannot move or act. The ice shatters, and the creature is freed if it takes any additional damage.

          You swirl your hands in the air, producing a thick fog centered on you. 
          The fog rolls out rapidly, spilling around corners and down slopes. 
          Within a few seconds, you blanket everything nearby in fog. 
          Creatures inside the fog cannot see beyond their reach, preventing them from making ranged attacks. 
          The fog disperses after you leave the area, or if the area is hit by strong winds.

          EAGLE: You gain eagle-eye vision for the next minute. 
          You can see anything in your line of sight clearly, even if it is far away, and you can detect faraway movement that would be imperceptible to a normal person.

          CAT: You purr softly under your breath, imbuing up to 6 nearby creatures with the spirit of the cat. 
          For the next hour, affected creatures gain the ability to see things nearby in complete darkness as if they were in a dimly lit room. 
          The effect cannot pierce magical darkness. Affected creatures may occasionally feel the urge to stop what they are doing and clean themselves.

          WOLF: You howl, imbuing up to 6 nearby creatures with haste. 
          For the next hour, creatures affected by the spell can outrun any other creatures while traveling by foot.

          You whisper a rhyming couplet to the living plants around you. 
          You can write your own or borrow one from another author. 
          Use one that plants might appreciate, like "Hear my voice ring, and welcome the spring."
      - text: >-
          Your brief poem entreats the plants to produce a harmless effect by moving or growing slightly. 
          The things you want to manipulate must be within range. 
          You may make trees rustle, cause leaves to fall, get plants to bloom, vines to expand, and seeds to sprout.

          You produce a tiny magical effect to surprise, delight, or confuse those around you. 
          Choose any combination of these effects each time you use this ability:
      - text: >-
          LIGHT: You create a harmless display of light, like a flickering flame or a pattern of sparks. 
          You can also snuff out or ignite small light sources like torches.
      - text: >-
          SOUND: You create a small, brief sound effect, like a wind chime, an audience clapping, or someone whispering.
      - text: >-
          SMELL: You conjure a smell of any kind, like a freshly baked pie or a cesspool.
      - text: >-
          TOUCH: You give one or more nearby creatures a gentle physical sensation, like someone tapping them on the shoulder,
          a chill breeze, or the feeling of goosebumps.

          You vanish momentarily, reappearing with two illusory duplicates at your side.
          Your duplicates travel alongside you and perfectly mimic all of your movements.
      - text: >-
          If a creature attempts to target you, the Guide must flip a coin. 
          If it turns up "heads," you are targeted; on "tails" one of your duplicates is targeted. 
          If one of your duplicates takes damage, it disappears.

          MAGIC: A faint aura surrounds any person or object currently affected by magic.
      - text: >-
          ILLUSION: Any illusory creature or object slightly flickers, but you do not see its true form.

          You summon an illusory bird somewhere nearby that keeps watch over an area that it can see. 
          It remains there until you dismiss it. You may only have one Little Bird at a time.
      - text: >-
          You share a telepathic link with the bird. 
          It will message you when it witnesses something you specify, like a specific creature entering a room or a door opening. 
          The bird will wake you up to tell you what it sees if you are sleeping.

          You make a nearby creature mildly confused about a specific subject until you leave the area. 
          For example, you could make a merchant confused about the value of their goods, 
          a guard confused about who is authorized to pass, or a dog confused about whether he is a good boy.
          The confusion is lifted if you push the deception too far, like trying to trade a rock for a priceless item.

          You extend your fingers outward, and a streaking bolt of sparks shoots toward a target you can see. 
          Roll the die to see if it hits the target successfully.
      - text: >-
          You may make the bolt explode on contact with crackling energy, hitting the target for 2 HP. 
          Or you can make the bolt a harmless firework that explodes in the air, creating a pattern 
          of any shape and color.
